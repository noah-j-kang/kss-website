# Baptist Housing Ministry Website Project

This is a personal project meant to update legacy UI. This website merges the three as a web-based platform for the Baptist Housing Ministry (BHM) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). It serves as a central hub for three Christian cooperative houses (Koinonia, Stratford, and Sutton) providing general information on community life, the application process, and upcoming events.
